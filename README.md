objective:
   Practice using SQL DML operations such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, and apply techniques for handling `NULL` values, default values, partial inserts, and safe deletion

   files included:
       1.sql code
       2.readme.md file
       3 output screenshots


work done by me:
  1.Inserted sample data into previously created Library tables
  2.Partial inserts (missing columns)
  3.Use of `NULL` and default behavior
  4.Updates using `WHERE` (single & multiple rows)
  5.Deletion of rows with referential handling
  6.`ON DELETE CASCADE` to maintain relational integrity
  7. Included rollback concept for safety (commented)
